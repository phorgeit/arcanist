This document describes how to set Certificate Authority information.
Usually, you need to do this only if you're using a self-signed certificate.


OSX after Yosemite
==================

If you're using a version of Mac OSX after Yosemite, you can not configure
certificates from the command line. All arcanist options related to CA
configuration are ignored.

Instead, you need to add them to the system keychain. The easiest way to do this
is to visit the site in Safari and choose to permanently accept the certificate.

You can also use `security add-trusted-cert` from the command line.


All Other Systems
=================

If "curl.cainfo" is not set, Arcanist uses the "default.pem" certificate
authority bundle when making HTTPS requests with cURL. This bundle is extracted
from Mozilla's certificates by cURL:

  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html

If you want to use a different CA bundle (for example, because you use
self-signed certificates), set "curl.cainfo", or create a file (or symlink) in
this directory named "custom.pem".

If "custom.pem" is present, that file will be used instead of "default.pem".

If you receive errors using your "custom.pem" file, you can test it directly
with `curl` by running a command like this:

  curl -v --cacert arcanist/resources/ssl/custom.pem https://phorge.example.com/

Replace "arcanist/resources/ssl/custom.pem" with the path to your "custom.pem"
file, and replace "https://phorge.example.com" with the real URL of your Phorge
install.

The initial lines of output from `curl` should give you information about the
SSL handshake and certificate verification, which may be helpful in resolving
the issue.
