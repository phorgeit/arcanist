Instructions for developing XHPAST.

= XHPAST Development Builds =

To develop XHPAST, you need to install flex and bison.
If they are not available as packages for your system, then you can get the
Flex source code at:

  https://github.com/westes/flex

When building, run `make scanner parser all` instead of `make` to build the
entire toolchain. By default the scanner and parser are not rebuild, to avoid
requiring normal users to install flex and bison.
